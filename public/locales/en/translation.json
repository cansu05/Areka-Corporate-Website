    "title": "Areka’s “Greencorn” Manifesto",
    "p1": "A concept we introduced to help rebalance the planet.",
    "p2": "We realized that existing labels are no longer sufficient to define the future of climate technology. That is why we introduced a new concept: greencorn. It represents visionary ventures that do not only reach billion-dollar valuations, but also measurably improve the world as they grow. We coined the concept, and Areka became its first example.",
    "p3": "Humanity is facing the greatest carbon pressure in its history. Emissions continue to rise, and carbon is no longer just a scientific metric—it has become a strategic economic indicator. In this new equation, success belongs to projects that combine financial growth with restoring the planet’s carbon balance. This is exactly where Areka’s greencorn approach comes into play.",
    "subtitle": "What does Areka do?",
    "p4": "Our platform connects businesses and individuals through a seamless ecosystem by combining an AI-powered carbon footprint engine with blockchain-level transparency. Whether it is an e-commerce purchase, a fuel transaction, or a digital payment, every action can be offset within seconds via Areka’s APIs. Reducing carbon impact becomes a natural part of everyday life, rather than a burdensome reporting exercise.",
    "p5": "What makes our model unique is its focus on mass participation. By breaking carbon credits into small digital units, Areka enables users to offset even a coffee-sized amount of CO₂. A customer scans their monthly electricity bill, taps a few times, and offsets their impact—while behavioral insights within the app first encourage reduction, and then offsetting what remains.",
    "p6": "Our vision for the future is clear: carbon offsetting should not be a passive donation, but a living economic transaction. With regulation-compliant certification, real-time accounting, and an ambitious expansion plan, we aim to spread the greencorn movement from Türkiye to all emerging markets.",
    "p7": "Ultimately, Areka’s greencorn manifesto is not merely a technological claim—it is a collective invitation. A more balanced planet—economically and ecologically—lies in our everyday choices.",
    "p8": "Through Areka, joining this transformation has never been easier. Let’s grow together while healing the world."

      "title": "Why Does Areka Measure Individual Carbon Footprints?",
      "p1": "While industrial and energy sectors are at the center of climate policies, total individual emissions in our country reach approximately 570 million tons of CO₂—exceeding emissions from industrial sources.",
      "p2": "Even when reduced by half, this often overlooked impact has the power to offset industrial emissions at a national scale.",
      "p3": "Areka makes the critical role of individual emissions visible by measuring carbon footprints in real time and turning them into a transparent and balanceable process.",
      "p4": "In this way, individual awareness transforms into a real, climate-positive impact at a societal level."

      "p1": "The Calculate – Record – Offset – Certify approach brings carbon emission calculation, recording, offsetting, and certification together in a single, holistic structure. Areka manages all these steps from one central point on behalf of companies, delivering a complete solution without any external dependencies.",
      "p2": "Companies can create separate offset certificates for their users and products based on their own measurements. These certificates can be added to products as barcodes or sent directly to users’ Areka accounts as digital certificates.",
      "p3": "Only high-integrity carbon credits are used—projects verified by international standards that are reliable and deliver real additional impact.",
      "p4": "Blockchain-based verification ensures that all offsetting transactions are recorded transparently, traceably, and immutably.",
      "p5": "Democratic offsetting through micro-units: carbon credits are divided into micro units, making individual contributions clear and measurable.",
      "p6": "Certified and NFT-verifiable impact: every offsetting transaction is documented with digital certificates that include QR code and NFT verification.",
      "p7": "Sustainability reporting–ready structure: each certificate used for offsetting can be actively included and reported in year-end sustainability and impact reports."
